The following is a list of currently active AMPRnet-JA "ampr"
newsgroups as of 10 Jun 1994. This list only includes newsgroups
which belong to ampr hierarchy. AMPRnet-JA now carries a lot of
non-ampr newsgroups. Most of them contain regional topics usually
within limited distribution.

The ampr hierachy has no moderated newsgroup mainly because
the Terakoya system now lacks support. Most of AMPRnet-JA sites
only participate on NetNews activities and electronic mail to
them is often unreachable.

The ampr newsgroups are distributed around the entire AMPRnet-JA,
and this implies nation-wide (inside Japan) distribution. However,
not all groups might actually enjoy such wide distribution, since
AMPRnet-JA subscribers can create and even delete newsgroups freely
as they want.

Contact your NetNews neighbours for latest availables in ampr and
local newsgroups.
